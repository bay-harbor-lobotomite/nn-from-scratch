# neural networks from scratch
Was always curious about how neural network libraries actually work so decided to implement a few neural networks by hand, purely educational, no utility. shoutout my guy karpathy

# Shit I used
- [Google's guide to machine learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/)
- [Karpathy's guide](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) (skipped the visualization sections and "PyTorch-ification" in makemore 3 because I'm lazy, need to revisit T-T)
- Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning book
- [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html)
- (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html)
- [Negative log likelihood](https://learningdaily.dev/understanding-maximum-likelihood-estimation-in-machine-learning-22b915c3e05a)
